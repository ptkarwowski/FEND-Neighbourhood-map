# My Neighborhood Map
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App] 

### Target of the project:

The requirements:
 - Responsive for mobile and Web
 - Add at least 5 places to the map
 - Show a search list of the places
 - The list can be filtered
 - Clicking on the list shows something about the place
 - Clicking on a marker shows something about the place 
 - Include a service worker (Used react's default)
